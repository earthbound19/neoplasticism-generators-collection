# DESCRIPTION
This repository collects various open-source neoplasticism-style (like Piet Mondrian's work) generators I have found all over the place. I may also tweak or extend any of them.

Each such generator is in its own subdirectory, with either a README.md with relevant information or (more likely) documentation in the code comments. I'm not doing recursive git repo dependency thingers like that. These don't update automagically from remotes or whatever.

# WHY
Because.
