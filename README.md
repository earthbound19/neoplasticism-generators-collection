# DESCRIPTION
This repository collects various open-source neoplasticism-style (like Piet Mondrian's work) generators I have found all over the place. I may also tweak or extend any of them.

Each such generator is in its own subdirectory, with either a README.md with relevant information or (more likely) documentation in the code comments. I'm not doing recursive git repo dependency thingers like that. These don't update automagically from remotes or whatever.

# WHY
Because.

# LIST OF THINGS TO COLLECT HERE
Part of the point of this is to archive source code found elsewhere. To archive:

- a Processing implementation of [a Mondrianeque algorithm](https://github.com/christophermoverton/Processing/blob/master/MondrianLikeSubdivision/MondrianLikeSubdivision.pde)
- various: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36435261/mondrian-art-program-python
- [Mondrian generator 3.0](https://github.com/AnoAn/Mondrian-generator)
- http://www.transcrypt.org/live/turtle_site/turtle_site.html -- more brutal
- [Results are mediocre](https://github.com/JEFworks/mondrian-generator) (poorly proportioned) -- lists other mondrian generators
- various? The same? https://newsfeed.kosmograd.com/generative-de-stijl/
- [Mondify, the Victory Boogie Woogie Generator](http://www.victory-boogie-woogie.appspot.com/)
- Which if any of these generators does this paper relate to? https://www.fujipress.jp/jaciii/jc/jacii001600070894/
- a [twitter bot coded in nodeJS](https://github.com/airhadoken/neoplastibot)

# AKTULLY . . .
That's hardly Mondrian, but it is useful or neat as something else:

- A [Filter Forge filter](https://www.filterforge.com/filters/7705.html)
- Another [Filter Forge fitler](https://www.filterforge.com/filters/11627.html)
- A [random colored rectangles generator](https://github.com/MechCoder/mondrian-art) much better than a javascript one I found (the rectangle edges stay within the canvas instead of overlapping it).
