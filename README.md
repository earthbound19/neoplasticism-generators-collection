# DESCRIPTION
This repository collects various open-source neoplasticism-style (like Piet Mondrian's work) generators I have found all over the place. I may also tweak or extend any of them.

Each such generator is in its own subdirectory, with either a README.md with relevant information or (more likely) documentation in the code comments. I'm not doing recursive git repo dependency thingers like that. These don't update automagically from remotes or whatever.

# WHY
Because.

# LIST OF THINGS TO COLLECT HERE
Part of the point of this is to archive source code found elsewhere. To archive:

- various: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36435261/mondrian-art-program-python
- Takes Fogleman's work and makes SVGs! : https://scipython.com/blog/computer-generated-mondrian-art-1/
- [Mondrian generator 3.0](https://github.com/AnoAn/Mondrian-generator)
- http://www.transcrypt.org/live/turtle_site/turtle_site.html -- more brutal
- [Results are mediocre](https://github.com/JEFworks/mondrian-generator) (poorly proportioned) -- lists other mondrian generators

# AKTULLY . . .
That's hardly Mondrian, but it is useful or neat as something else:

- A [Filter Forge filter](https://www.filterforge.com/filters/7705.html)
- Another [Filter Forge fitler](https://www.filterforge.com/filters/11627.html)
- A [random colored rectangles generator](https://github.com/MechCoder/mondrian-art) much better than a javascript one I found (the rectangle edges stay within the canvas instead of overlapping it).
